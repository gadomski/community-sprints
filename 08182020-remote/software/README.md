## Software STAC Sprint Aug 18+20

The 'software' portion of [STAC Sprint #6](https://medium.com/radiant-earth-insights/join-us-for-stac-sprint-6-our-first-fully-remote-event-28e118a5279c) starts
on August 18th. The event will be run completely remotely. We aim to have a 'kick-off' at [13:00 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=STAC+Sprint+%236+Kickoff&iso=20200818T13&p1=1440),
on the first day but we encourage you to start at the beginning of your day.

The plan is to have most of the time focused on actually working on STAC, with a few different zoom rooms open so people can collaborate and ask questions. We will
have one room that is more focused on new users, but for this part of the sprint we expect participants to be software developers who are capable of diving in, 
writing code and submitting pull requests. So the beginner session will just be a brief overview of the specification & ecosystem, and then will mostly focus
on Q&A to get people up to speed. 

## Communication

There will be two main channels of communication during the sprint.

**Gitter** for asynchronous chat. We'll start with using the main [STAC gitter room](https://gitter.im/SpatioTemporal-Asset-Catalog/Lobby), but can make additional
breakout rooms if there is a need for small group async discussions.

**Zoom** for voice/video/screensharing. The kickoff session will be on zoom. We will set up a handful of open rooms that people can choose to join, and also enable
break out zoom sessions. Planet can provide zoom rooms, but others can also just use other video tools - just post details in this repo and on the gitter channel.

*Main Zoom Link*: The primary zoom link is XXX (will update here if it changes) This is where the kick-off session will happen,
and you are encouraged to join it when you start your day. It may well get a bit crowded, so we will aim to have a number of smaller 'rooms' (details below). But 
it should serve as a place to check-in and ask questions. Please try to use [gitter](https://gitter.im/SpatioTemporal-Asset-Catalog/Lobby) in favor of zoom chat, 
unless it is something specific to the call / not STAC related.

## Schedule

### Pre-work


* **Add help offered/wanted and ideas** - Prepare for the sprint by posting to the [STAC Sprint Ideas + Help Offered/Wanted](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dk4M0i0_LWWGHlMw4Xd0RRzWeWIXIRM4q_98qNBTV0w/edit) google doc.
* **Familiarize yourself with STAC if you are not already**: For the software sprint we are assuming most people will hit the ground running, with at least some
understanding of STAC. If you are not yet familiar then please read up on the [website](http://stacspec.org) and the [spec itself](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec). If you're comfortable with Python then the [PySTAC Tutorials](https://pystac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html)
are also a great place to start. And you can watch a [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjJTkxzse6A&feature=youtu.be) of the tutorial from the last sprint.

### Kickoff August 18th

We've got people coming from lots of different timezones, and we want to keep you working in your normal work hours. So consider the start of the sprint 
whenever you normally get started on work. Kick-off the day by doing two things:

* **Post a written intro** - Share who you are, what your background is, and what you're hoping to work on this sprint. Do this on the [STAC Sprint #6 - Software section Introductions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IGgYhnJ5GKW-QGueiix4evJV9pJ7HV9dyciQYako5Ws/edit#) google doc.

* **Sign-on to Gitter and say 'hi!'** - It should be easy to join gitter, just go to https://gitter.im/SpatioTemporal-Asset-Catalog/Lobby and log-on. Kick off 
the day by introducing yourself to the group and say what you're working on. We'll also have some Zoom rooms open, so you can jump on video and say hi there

From there you can look at the [STAC Sprint Ideas + Help Offered/Wanted](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dk4M0i0_LWWGHlMw4Xd0RRzWeWIXIRM4q_98qNBTV0w/edit)
document to find something to work on, or just dive into the project you had in mind.

Then at [13:00 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=STAC+Sprint+%236+Kickoff&iso=20200818T13&p1=1440) we will all gather on zoom to 
say hi, so we can associate faces with names, and figure out collaborations.

Note that we're not 100% certain the video links will all work right. We'll aim to use Planet's Zoom rooms, but if you want to set up any other type of meeting then
go for it. Just update on gitter and update this document.

|**Time**|**Title**|**Link**|**Description**|
|--------|---------|--------------|---------------|
|Start of your day | **Remote Introduction**  | gitter: [STAC Lobby](https://gitter.im/SpatioTemporal-Asset-Catalog/Lobby) | Post your [introduction](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IGgYhnJ5GKW-QGueiix4evJV9pJ7HV9dyciQYako5Ws/edit#), login to [gitter](https://gitter.im/SpatioTemporal-Asset-Catalog/Lobby) and say hi, and what you're working on or are interested in.|
|[13:00 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=STAC+Sprint+%236+Kickoff&iso=20200818T13&p1=1440)| **Zoom Kick-off & introductions** | zoom: [931-8714-4321](https://planet.zoom.us/j/93187144321) |Put names to faces, with everyone sharing their introduction, and quick introductions of projects you are hoping to work on and/or where you want to help|
| [14:25 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?&iso=20200818T1425&p1=1440) | *SpaceX Launch* (optional) |  zoom: [931-8714-4321](https://planet.zoom.us/j/93187144321)  (same as kick-off) to watch with people, or direct at https://www.spacex.com/launches/ | Optional viewing of [SpaceX Launch with 3 Planet SkySats](https://www.planet.com/pulse/skysats-19-21-to-launch-on-spacex-falcon-9-rideshare-mission/), if it doesn't get scrubbed |
| ~[14:45 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?&iso=20200818T1425&p1=1440) | **Group Kick-offs** | See [room info](#room-info) | Smaller group work, see the [room info](#room-info). Most group sessions will kick off a bit after the main intro session ends. We'll cap it at 1.5 hours, but it may end earlier than that. |
| [15:30 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?&iso=20200818T1530&p1=1440) | *Intro to STAC Q&A* | zoom: [918-0718-9441](https://planet.zoom.us/j/91807189441) | This will be an informal session doing a brief overview of the specification, and then extended Q&A for any questions. If you want a full introduction to STAC then it'd be best to wait for the 'outreach day' on September 8th. This session starts an hour after the others, so if you intend to come please use the hour to read up on the [website](http://stacspec.org) and the [spec itself](http://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec). And if you're comfortable with Python then the [PySTAC Tutorials](https://pystac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html) are also a great place to start. And you can watch a recording of the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjJTkxzse6A&feature=youtu.be) from the last sprint. |
| [17:00 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?&iso=20200818T17&p1=1440) and every two hours after that | **chat check-ins** | gitter: [STAC Lobby](https://gitter.im/SpatioTemporal-Asset-Catalog/Lobby) | For in person sprints we'd often have quick in person check-ins every couple hours to see if cross-group coordination was needed. That feels unwieldy with zoom, so let's just try to have each 'group' that is working try to post progress every 2 hours. Update others on your progress, and any conversations / help you need to have, since many people will want to be in several topics but can't join every conversation. We can also try video check-ins on the main channel|


### Optional Day August 19th

The 'official' sprint is just August 18th and 20th, so that people can hopefully pause on their day jobs on those days to really focus on STAC software topics. 
So for the 19th we expect people to try to schedule more of their 'work' meetings, but we hope at least some people will continue to work on STAC topics this day. 
The same ['rooms'](#room-info) will remain open, on zoom and chat, so feel free to use them and check-in.  

## August 20th - Final Software Sprint

|**Time**|**Title**|**Link**|**Description**|
|--------|---------|--------------|---------------|
|Start of your day | **Remote Check-in**  | gitter: [STAC Lobby](https://gitter.im/SpatioTemporal-Asset-Catalog/Lobby) | Drop a line in gitter when you get started for the day, on what you're going to work on. Feel free to also drop by the [main zoom room](https://planet.zoom.us/j/93187144321) to say hi to anyone working at the same time.|
|[13:00 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=STAC+Sprint+%236+Kickoff&iso=20200818T13&p1=1440)| **Zoom Check-in** | zoom: [931-8714-4321](https://planet.zoom.us/j/93187144321) |Optional updates on progress and calls for help|
| End of your day | **Virtual Wrap-up** | gitter: [STAC Lobby](https://gitter.im/SpatioTemporal-Asset-Catalog/Lobby) | Update [the progress page](progress.md) with what you did during the sprint. You can also record your [demo video](progress.md#demo-videos), though they aren't due until Sunday at midnight |

### Wrap-up

We are not going to try to do a final 'wrap up' section, as in past sprints, since everyone will be ending their days at different times. But there are two key 
things you should do, to enable our 'virtual wrap up'.

1. Update [the progress page](progress.md) with any STAC related work you did during the sprint. This can be anything with the ecosystem, and in addition to writing
code can include testing, packaging, documentation, spec editing, cataloging data, etc - really anything that helps.

2. Record your [demo video](progress.md#demo-videos). You can do this at the end of your day if you want to get it out of the way. But if you're working on 
finishing something they are not due until Sunday at midnight (in whatever time zone has the most friendly midnight). See the [demo video](progress.md#demo-videos)
for more information. We may try to have a 'viewing party' of some sort, and we'll also aim for a subset of the videos to evolve into lightning talks at the 
outreach day.

3. Tweet out any progress you've made or positive words about the sprint - use the #STACSprint6 hashtag. Sharing our progress publicly enables these to continue to 
happen.
